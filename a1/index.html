              Tyrnauer focuses less on the frothy glamour of Studio and more about how it
              fell apart.

            <li>Ian avoided talking about Studio for 40 years.</li>
            <li>He was ashamed because he went to prison.</li>
            <li>He started to open up when his kids were curios.</li>
            <li>
              When he began to have conversations with them, he perceived that they had no
              difficulty accepting both the great and the terrible aspects of the story.

              unpredictable and harsh door policy.
